# Meh-culator ðŸ§®

A sarcastic, slightly rude calculator written in Python.  
It lets you perform basic math operations while mocking your life choices.  

---

## Features

- Supports the following operations:
  - Addition (`+`)
  - Subtraction (`-`)
  - Multiplication (`*`)
  - Division (`/`)  
    _(with extra judgment if you try to divide by zero)_
  - Exponentiation (`^`)
- Lets you choose how many equations you want to solve (but complains if it's too many).
- Gives you the option to quit early if you're boring and dumb.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher (tested with Python 3.12.3).
- No external libraries required (only uses the built-in `time` module).

---
